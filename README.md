## Implementation of Decrease and Conquer
This program use approach of topological sorting which have concept of decrease and conquer. My implementation in this program is trying to take off few vertice who have no edge in (and don't forget to delete all edge out from vertice that has been deleted), after that my program will try solve the "new graph" (graph that has been simplified). If my program think the graph is still too complex to solve then it will repeat the procedur untill the graph simple enough.
